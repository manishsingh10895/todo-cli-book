# Learning rust by building an unnecessarily complex Todo CLI

Learning rust is **hard** and so is finding decent projects online that will help understand the workings of the language while 
also giving a deep and easy enough view of the projects so that it will help us structure it. 

So owing to my own desire of learning of not just how to `rust` but to build a project here is , `Building an unnecessarily 
complex TODO CLI`.


## Who is this for 

I have tried to make this beginner friendly but, it'll help the person reading to have the great 
[rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book) given a good look. 


## What will we learn

* Building database models using [Diesel ORM](https://diesel.rs/)
* Booting up a web server for api using [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/)
* Authentication in APIs with [JWT](https://jwt.io)
* Building a CLI using [Clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/)
* Creating a terminal based UI for our CLI using [Tui-rs](https://github.com/fdehau/tui-rs)
 and [Crossterm](https://github.com/crossterm-rs/crossterm)

So if the the things listed above, intrigues you. Let carry on.
