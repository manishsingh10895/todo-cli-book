# Learning Rust by building an unnecessarily complex cli in rust (WIP)

This repository is a book written as a tutorial for a building a `rust todo cli` in which we 
build a `cli` with `actix_web` server, `diesel` ORM, `postgres` database and `tui-rs` terminal ui framework. 

So a lots to learn and a (slightly) decent project to build.

The source code for the titular `TODO CLI` can be found [here](https://github.com/manishsingh10895/rust_todo)


## Reading the book 
The book is still a **WORK IN PROGRESS**, so i didn't host it somewhere yet. 

 Though you can manually build and serve it locally.

It is built using [`mdbook`](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/)

## Building and serving locally

> `cargo install mdbook`

> `mdbook serve --open`
